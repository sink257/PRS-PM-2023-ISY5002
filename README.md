## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
With the rapid advancement of generative Artificial Intelligence models like ChatGPT and Midjourney, the easy generation of synthetic data presents ethical issues which can deceive users with misleading and/or fake news. In particular, the creation of realistic synthetic images has become increasingly prevalent by spreading misinformation through the uploading of deepfakes. These images, generated by algorithms, can often be indistinguishable from photographs taken by physical cameras or created by human artists. This phenomenon has raised concerns regarding the potential for misinformation and manipulation in visual media. 

The project seeks to address this issue by developing a machine learning model capable of accurately discerning between images generated by AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms and those of real images taken by a camera. This distinction is crucial for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of visual content in various domains, including journalism, forensics, and content moderation. 

The objective of this project is to create an intuitive front-end user interface enabling users to upload images for classification. The interface will connect seamlessly with a backend machine learning model, trained on a comprehensive dataset, to accurately determine whether the uploaded image is artificially generated or a real image. This tool aims to provide a user-friendly solution for verifying the authenticity of visual content, addressing concerns related to synthetic imagery in the digital landscape.

## SECTION 5 : USER GUIDE
## Installation Instructions 

<ins>System Requirements</ins>
1) At least 4GB of RAM 
2) Internet connection 
3) Docker and Docker Compose to be installed on the system 

<ins>Installation Procedure</ins>
1) Install Docker and Docker Compose, if not yet installed. 
2) git clone the git repository (https://github.com/sink257/PRS-PM-2023-ISY5002.git) to a folder. 
3) Navigate into the SystemCode folder.
4) `chmod +x 00_buildFE.sh` and `chmod +x 01_buildBE.sh` to allow execution permissions of the build scripts. 
5) `./00_buildFE.sh` to build the frontend image and wait until it completes. 
6) `./01_buildBE.sh` to build the backend image and wait until it completes. 
7) `docker compose up -d` to start both the backend and frontend containers. 

After running the above steps, the website should be able to be viewed by accessing the browser and keying in the following address: http://<IP address>/ 

To stop the containers, navigate to the SystemCode folder and run the command: 
`docker compose down`

Note: The frontend website is hosted on port 80 and the backend API is hosted on port 8000. 

 

<ins>Troubleshooting</ins>  
Issue: After uploading of image and pressing continue, the prediction result does not show but just stays stuck with a black loading bar.  
Possible Cause: The backend API is not responding to the request, either due to a crash or some other error.  
Resolution: Check that the backend container is still running and not exited, by typing `docker ps`. If needed, restart the container by navigating to SystemCode folder and typing `docker compose up -d`. 
 

Issue: Image upload fails with a message saying the website has exceeded its free Bytescale limit.  
Possible Cause: Bytescale image upload service has hit the free API usage limit.  
Resolution: Create a Bytescale account and attach an API key by saving the following line NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_API_KEY="<API_KEY>" into a file named `.env` and place it into the frontend folder.
